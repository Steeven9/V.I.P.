Tasks:

Managed to login successfully. (mistakes were made afterwards so no more tasks for this group)

Feedback:

Add additional characters. Graphics are good.

The app is useful and convenient as, to unlock a character, you can have a
direct access to information without having to go on the internet.
It can be helpful for school.

Would suggest to a friend. Maybe add videos (possibly funny) that can interest
the user in the characters.

Add a game aspect to the app, possibly with quizzes regarding the unlocked characters.

Unlocking a character through camera. Successful.

Viewing own profile. Successful.

Expanding character description. Successful.

Accepting or refusing a friend request. Successful.

Using settings menu. Found by mistake while looking for the home.

Feedback:

They liked it, navigation was intuitive. Add a quiz after a certain amount of
characters has been unlocked.

Initially confused about the unlocking mechanic (didn't get how they would unlock).

Question regarding what happens once they unlock all the characters. (answer was
that there will be added more characters as time goes on)

Unpredictable as your expectations of what the facial recognition could give you
might not be what you actually get.

It looks like fun. Simple and easy as the interface is nice to use. It is convincing,
interesting as it is inviting and new. Useful and well organised as they have all the
information they need there.

They would like to use it. Design and graphics are good.

Group 3:

Tasks:

Login. Successful.

Unlocking a character through camera. Successful.

Expanding character description. Successful, surprised and scared by the amount
of text that can be in a character's description.

Viewing a friend's profile. Successful. (interface hitbox was too small and made it tricky).

Accepting or refusing a friend request. Successful.

Finding a friend through search bar. Successful.

Using settings menu. Not found.

Feedback:

Question regarding the amount of characters they might be too many for one of them
while the other one asked if there will be more.

They would want a way to find friend requests more easily.

Clean, inviting and organised. Convincing as the name alone would make them download it.
